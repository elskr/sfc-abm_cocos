# Contingent Convertible Bonds and Macroeconomic Stability in a Stock-Flow Consistent Agent-Based Model

## Overview

The folder contains the model-specific code empolyed for the model presented in the paper "Contingent Convertible Bonds and Macroeconomic Stability in a Stock-Flow Consistent Agent-Based Model" and additional materials to run simulations by your own and analyze results.

The code requires and builds upon the JMAB platform (<a href="https://github.com/S120/jmab">JMAB project</a>): a Java framework for building macro stock-flow consistent agent-based simulation models. A simulation model is constructed using <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a> by creating a <a href="https://blog.mafr.de/2007/11/01/configuration-with-spring-beans/">Spring beans</a> configuration file which specifies which classes to use in the simulation and the values of any attributes (parameters). The Spring configuration file is specified using the system property jabm.config.

## Additional Contents

The folder "paper" contains:
- The pdf document of the paper presenting the model

- All the Plots Produced in the Experiments. In the case of the sensitivity experiments lighter grey lines correspond to higher values of the parameter.

- The Executable Files to run simulations of the model by your own (in both the Baseline Empirical Validation and Policy Experiments Scenarios) and the R Scripts required to transform and analyze the results, and plot the figures. (See Read Me doc. in the “Launch Simulations” Folder)

## Prerequisites

JMAB requires Java version 6 or later.

Note that on Mac OS, you will need to use the Oracle version of Java instead of the default one shipped with the OS.

## Installation

The project archive can be imported directly into the Eclipse IDE as an existing project.

## Running the examples from the Eclipse IDE

The distribution archive can be imported directly into the Eclipse IDE by using the File/Import menu item. Create a launch configuration in the benchmark project with the main class benchmark.Main and specify which configuration file you want to use by setting the system property jabm.config using the JVM argument -D , for example

-Djabm.config=model/mainBaseline.xml

## Documentation

The folder documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/S120/jmab">JMAB project</a> contains a user guide.

The folder paper contains the last working paper version of the model description, plus the data generated by the simulation used for the paper, and the corresponding graphs. It also contains a jar that can be used to run the simulation directly from the console
